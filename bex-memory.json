This allows me to perform a wide range of tasks, including:\n\n*   **Answering Questions:** I can provide information on a diverse array of topics, drawing from my knowledge base. Whether you're curious about history, science, current events, or pretty much anything else, I'll do my best to give you a comprehensive and accurate answer.\n*   **Generating Text Formats:** I can create different kinds of creative content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I can also adapt my writing style to suit your needs.\n*   **Translating Languages:** I can translate text from one language to another.\n*   **Summarizing Information:** I can condense long pieces of text into shorter, more digestible summaries, highlighting the key points.\n*   **Engaging in Conversation:** I can participate in dialogue, understand context, and respond in a coherent and relevant manner.\n*   **Assisting with Creative Writing:** If you're working on a story, poem, or any other creative project, I can help brainstorm ideas, suggest plot points, or even write sections for you.\n*   **Explaining Complex Concepts:** I can break down difficult subjects into simpler terms to make them easier to understand.\n*   **Coding Assistance:** I can help with generating code snippets, explaining programming concepts, and even debugging.\n\nEssentially, think of me as a highly knowledgeable and versatile assistant for anything involving language and information. I'm here to help you learn, create, and explore!\n\nHow can I assist you today?"

Please tell me:\n\n1.  **What programming language do you want the code in?** (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Ruby, Go, etc.)\n2.  **What should the code do?** Be as specific as possible. For example:\n    *   \"Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.\"\n    *   \"Write a script that reads a CSV file and prints the first 5 rows.\"\n    *   \"Generate a simple HTML page with a heading and a paragraph.\"\n    *   \"Create a Python class for a 'Car' with attributes like make, model, and year.\"\n    *   \"Write a JavaScript function to validate an email address.\"\n\nThe more details you provide, the better I can tailor the code to your needs!"

My purpose is to process and generate text, not to interact with your operating system or file management.\n\n**To list your files, you would typically use commands or tools provided by your operating system:**\n\n*   **On Windows:**\n    *   Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and type `dir` or `ls`.\n    *   Open **File Explorer** and navigate to the desired folder.\n\n*   **On macOS or Linux:**\n    *   Open the **Terminal** and type `ls` (for a basic list) or `ls -l` (for a detailed list).\n    *   Open **Finder** (macOS) or your file manager (Linux) and navigate to the desired folder.\n\nIf you're trying to achieve something specific with your files (like processing them in some way with code), please tell me more about that goal, and I can help you write code that *would* do that if you were to run it on your own system. For example, you could ask for code to:\n\n*   \"Write a Python script to list all `.txt` files in a specific directory.\"\n*   \"Give me a Bash command to find all files modified in the last 24 hours.\""

Ask the user to choose an operation.\n2.  Ask the user to enter two numbers.\n3.  Perform the calculation.\n4.  Display the result.\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n  \"\"\"Adds two numbers\"\"\"\n  return x + y\n\ndef subtract(x, y):\n  \"\"\"Subtracts two numbers\"\"\"\n  return x - y\n\ndef multiply(x, y):\n  \"\"\"Multiplies two numbers\"\"\"\n  return x * y\n\ndef divide(x, y):\n  \"\"\"Divides two numbers\"\"\"\n  if y == 0:\n    return \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n  return x / y\n\nprint(\"Select operation:\")\nprint(\"1.

Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n4.  Run the script using the command: `python calculator.py`\n\nLet me know if you'd like any modifications or a more advanced version!"
